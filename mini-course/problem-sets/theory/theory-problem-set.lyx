\begin_layout Section
Subsidizing under-consumed goods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this question, we consider consumers who undervalue some product, 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, like healthy food or energy-efficient upgrades, because of incorrect beliefs
 or inattention.
 Consumers start out with some income 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

, and they maximize the utility function 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{U}=\hat{\alpha}\ln(x)+(y-(p-s)x-T)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is the price set by producers, 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 is the subsidy set by the government, 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is the lump-sum tax, and 
\begin_inset Formula $y-(p-s)x-T$
\end_inset

 is spending on the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

numeraire
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 good.
 Consumers' true utility is instead given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
U=\alpha\ln(x)+(y-(p-s)x-T)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\geq\hat{\alpha}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 can be any non-negative real number.
 The lump-sum tax 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 must balance the budget: if consumers choose 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{*}(s)$
\end_inset

 given a subsidy 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $T(s)=s\cdot x^{*}(s)$
\end_inset

.
 Assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 is large enough such that the choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is always interior (i.e., it is characterized by a first-order condition).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
1.1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For parts 1.1- 1.5, assume that the producer price is fixed because the good
 is produced by a price-taking firm with constant marginal costs of production
 (graphically, this means that the supply curve is flat).
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{*}(s)$
\end_inset

 be choice as a function of the subsidy.
 Show that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{d}{ds}\left[\alpha\ln(x)-(p-s)x^{*}(s)\right]=\frac{\alpha}{p-s}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
1.2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{*}(s)$
\end_inset

 be choice as a function of the subsidy.
 Show that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{d}{ds}\left[sx^{*}(s)\right]=\frac{\hat{\alpha}p}{(p-s)^{2}}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
1.3
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the derivations above, show that the optimal subsidy must satisfy
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{p-s}{p}=\frac{\hat{\alpha}}{\alpha}.
\]

\end_inset

What is the intuition behind this equation? Explain why this subsidy obtains
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

first best
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

â€”i.e., welfare that would be achieved if no consumers misoptimized.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
1.4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose now that a fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 of consumers have 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\alpha}=\hat{\alpha}_{L}<\alpha$
\end_inset

 and a fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $1-q$
\end_inset

 of consumers have a 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\alpha}=\hat{\alpha}_{H}=\alpha$
\end_inset

.
 Using 2.1 and 2.2 above, generalize 2.3 to show that the optimal subsidy must
 satisfy 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{p-s}{p}=q\frac{\hat{\alpha}_{L}}{\alpha}+(1-q).
\]

\end_inset

Explain the intuition, and explain why this subsidy can no longer achieve
 first-best welfare.
 (The government must still maintain a balanced budget, meaning that the
 lump-sum tax 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 must equal the total amount of subsidy paid out to the two types of consumers.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $T=s\left[qx_{L}^{*}+(1-q)x_{H}^{*}\right],$
\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{L}^{*}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{H}^{*}$
\end_inset

 are the respective consumption choices of type 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 consumers.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
1.5
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

poor
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 consumers have 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\alpha}=\hat{\alpha}_{L}$
\end_inset

 while 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rich
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 consumers have 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\alpha}=\hat{\alpha}_{H}$
\end_inset

.
 This means that rich people buy more 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 than poor people.
 A progressive politician named Bennie Xanders gives a speech about how
 the subsidy calculated in 2.4 above would be regressive, since it would
 end up being distributed to the rich much more than to the poor.
 Using your calculations in 2.4, explain why Bennie's concept of regressivity
 is incorrect, and that in fact the subsidy benefits the rich and the poor
 consumers equally.
 Explain the intuition behind why standard concepts of regressivity have
 to be refined with behavioral consumers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
1.6
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the rest of this question (1.6-1.10), assume that the supply of good 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is fixed.
 The firm supplying this good is still a price-taking firm.
 (Graphically, this means that the supply curve is a vertical line.) Explain
 why when 
\begin_inset Formula $q=1$
\end_inset

 (all consumers are homogeneous), the first-best welfare obtains with no
 subsidy.
 Unless you prefer, you don't have to do any math here.
 Hint: You may find it helpful to recall our discussion about how tax salience
 does not affect deadweight loss of taxation with vertical supply, since
 it does not affect equilibrium quantity sold and purchased.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
1.7
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Explain why, when 
\begin_inset Formula $0<q<1$
\end_inset

, the first-best welfare no longer obtains.
 But also explain why subsidizing (or taxing) can't improve things.
 Hint: Think about the principles of misallocation due to heterogeneous
 consumer bias that we discussed in the context of sales tax salience.
 Unless you prefer, you don't have to do any math here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
1.8
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Go back to the case in which 
\begin_inset Formula $q=1$
\end_inset

.
 Imagine a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nudge
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that fully debiases consumers.
 Explain why this nudge would increase profits of the price-taking firm
 and decrease consumer surplus.
 (Consider doing this graphically by drawing the supply and demand curves.)
 Would the result of the nudge be different if instead the supply curve
 was flat?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
1.9
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Go back to the case in which 
\begin_inset Formula $q=1$
\end_inset

.
 Imagine a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nudge
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that debiases half of the consumers.
 Explain why this nudge would lower the sum of consumer and producer surplus
 (i.e., would lower social welfare).
 Hint: Use 1.6 and 1.7.
 Would the result of the nudge be different if instead the supply curve
 was flat?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
1.10
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Building on 2.8 and 2.9, explain why, generally speaking, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nudges
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are unlikely to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

choice-preserving
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 policy tools (i.e., do not affect consumers' choice-sets) in markets with
 endogenous prices.

\begin_layout Section
Tax salience and welfare
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a set-up similar to problem 1, where consumers have 
\emph on
true
\emph default
 utility given by 
\begin_inset Formula $U(x)=u(x)+(y-(p+t)x)$
\end_inset

.
 Suppose that instead of maximizing 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

, consumers choose 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 to maximize 
\begin_inset Formula $u(x)+(y-(p+\theta t)x)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 is the tax salience parameter.
 Suppose that the government wants to maximize social welfare, given by
 
\begin_inset Formula $W(t)=U(x^{*})+\lambda tx^{*}(t)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $tx^{*}(t)$
\end_inset

 is the tax revenue and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\geq1$
\end_inset

 is the value of public funds.
 Assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $u(x)=ax-\frac{1}{2}x^{2}$
\end_inset

, for 
\begin_inset Formula $a>p$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
2.1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a consumer with salience parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

, show that the demand is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{*}(t)=\max(a-p-\theta t,0)$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
2.2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prove that for 
\begin_inset Formula $p+\theta t<a$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{d}{dt}U(x^{*}(t))=-x^{*}+(1-\theta)\theta t=p+\theta t-a+(1-\theta)\theta t$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
2.3
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prove that the tax 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 that maximizes 
\begin_inset Formula $W(t)$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $t=\frac{(\lambda-1)(a-p)}{2\theta(\lambda-1)+\theta^{2}}$
\end_inset

 (assuming 
\begin_inset Formula $a>p+\theta t$
\end_inset

 at that value), and thus that the optimal tax is decreasing in 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

.
 Prove also that 
\begin_inset Formula $\max_{t}W(t)$
\end_inset

, the maximum obtainable welfare, is decreasing in 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

.
 What is the intuition?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
2.4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose now that a fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 of consumers have 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta=\theta_{l}$
\end_inset

 and a fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $1-\alpha$
\end_inset

 of consumers have 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta=\theta_{h}$
\end_inset

.
 Let social welfare be 
\begin_inset Formula $W=\alpha U(x_{l}^{*})+(1-\alpha)U(x_{h}^{*})+\lambda[\alpha tx_{l}^{*}(t)+(1-\alpha)tx_{h}^{*}(t)]$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{l}^{*}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{h}^{*}$
\end_inset

 are the demands of type 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{l}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{h}$
\end_inset

 consumers, respectively.
 Prove that the tax 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 that maximizes 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $t=\frac{(\lambda-1)(a-p)}{2E[\theta](\lambda-1)+E[\theta]^{2}+Var[\theta]}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $E[\theta]$
\end_inset

 is the average 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 in the population and 
\begin_inset Formula $Var[\theta]$
\end_inset

 is its variance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
2.5 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Together, parts c and d show that holding constant the average value of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 in the population, the optimal tax is decreasing in the variance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

.
 What is the intuition?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
2.6
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prove that even when 
\begin_inset Formula $E[\theta]<1$
\end_inset

, welfare would be higher if both types of consumers perceived the tax correctly
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{h}$
\end_inset

 is sufficiently high to make 
\begin_inset Formula $Var[\theta]>1$
\end_inset

.
 Draw a contrast to your answer in 2.3, and discuss the intuition.
